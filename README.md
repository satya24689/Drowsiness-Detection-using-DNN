# Drowsiness-Detection-using-DNN
# DESCRIPTION
The project focuses on creating a prototype system using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for detecting drowsiness in individuals, particularly in scenarios like transportation where safety is paramount. The objective is to develop a robust system that can accurately identify signs of drowsiness using indicators such as facial expressions, eye movements, and physiological signals. The methodology involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, evaluation, and prototype integration. The prototype includes modules for data acquisition, preprocessing, DNN model implementation, alerting mechanism by using camera application. The expected outcomes include a reliable prototype for real-time drowsiness detection, improved safety measures, and potential for further research in human behavior monitoring and safety systems. Overall, the project aims to contribute to enhanced safety and well-being by effectively addressing the issue of drowsiness detection.
